# Snake-Game
The well-known Nokia snake game created only with Java

In this game I used dependency injection, getters, setters and of course constructors.
Each class has a specific task to fulfil, just as the SOLID principles suggest.

This is an old project of mine and I struggled to create it myself.
For this reason I have used the tutorial of Bro Code in Youtube to help me. Also, from Stackoverflow some very kind people helped me to improve the code quality!
